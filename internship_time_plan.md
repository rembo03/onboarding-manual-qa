📅 Internship Time Plan – Badal Moreya
This document outlines my weekly schedule and availability.
Since I already have 4 months of onsite QA experience at DesignWay and 2 months of experience at Focus Bear, I am familiar with most tasks and workflows.
Because of this background, I can complete the remaining onboarding tasks efficiently (within 2 days) and start contributing to further work immediately — while continuing to learn and develop my skills.

🧑‍💻 Experience Summary (Why I Can Complete Tasks Faster)
Completed 4-month onsite internship at DesignWay (Web & App Testing).

Completed 2 months as a QA intern at Focus Bear, already familiar with:

QA processes

Issue reporting

Agile workflows

Documentation

Testing tools

Because of my previous experience, I can finish the onboarding tasks quickly and begin real QA work side-by-side with skill development.
