Testing as an Investigative Process

Overview  
This task is about seeing testing as an investigative activity. Instead of only following steps, I try to observe, question, and explore the app like a detective.

Research & Learn

Watch talks by James Bach and Michael Bolton on YouTube about context-driven testing and exploratory testing.  
Yes, I watched a few short videos to understand the basics.

Read blog posts by James Bach and Michael Bolton on the role of critical thinking in testing.  
Yes, I will go through it.

How does exploratory testing help testers uncover bugs that scripted tests might miss?  
Exploratory testing lets me try things that scripted tests usually don’t cover. I click around, change orders, try unusual inputs, and sometimes I find bugs that wouldn’t appear in a fixed test case.

What techniques can QA testers use to investigate software behavior systematically?  
Some techniques I use are:  
- repeating steps with small variations  
- checking logs or console errors  
- breaking the flow into smaller parts  
- trying edge cases  
These help me understand why something is happening.

How do questioning skills help uncover hidden issues?  
When I ask questions like “What if I try this?” or “Why did this happen?”, I start noticing patterns or behaviours that don’t look right. It helps me think deeper instead of only following steps.

What strategies do expert testers use to test when there are no clear requirements?  
I try to understand what the feature is meant to achieve, compare it with similar features, and think from a user’s point of view. I explore different paths until I understand how it behaves.

Reflection

What questions would you ask when testing a new Focus Bear feature for the first time?  
Some examples:  
- What is this feature supposed to do?  
- What happens if I use it differently than expected?  
- Does it connect to any other part of the app?  
- Is anything confusing for a first-time user?  

How can uncertainty and curiosity make you a better tester?  
When I’m curious, I explore more and don’t limit myself to obvious steps. Uncertainty makes me double-check things, which helps me catch bugs early.

What techniques could you use to dig deeper when a bug is difficult to reproduce?  
I try repeating the steps slowly and then fast, changing the order, checking logs, trying another device, and recording the screen. Sometimes just trying again helps reveal the pattern.
