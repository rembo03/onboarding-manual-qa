Alignment with my values and interests: Focus Bear aligns with my personal values of self-improvement, focus, and building practical life skills. I relate to the struggles it aims to solve because I’ve faced similar challenges in school, health, and social life.

Personal connection: I personally relate to Focus Bear’s purpose, as I have experienced difficulties focusing, managing routines, and balancing life. Tools like this can make a big difference for people like me.
