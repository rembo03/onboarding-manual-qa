Bug Advocacy – Reporting Bugs Effectively

Overview  
This task is about learning how to report bugs in a way that helps developers take action quickly. Good bug reporting is an important skill because how I communicate the issue can affect whether it gets fixed.

Research & Learn

Watch James Bach and Michael Bolton’s talks on Bug Advocacy and how testers can convince developers to fix issues.  
(Yes, I will go through it.)

Read blog posts by James Bach on how to write effective bug reports.  
I read a few articles to understand what details actually matter.

What makes a good bug report vs. a bad one?  
A good bug report is clear, easy to understand, and gives enough information for the developer to reproduce the issue.  
A bad bug report is vague, missing steps, or unclear about the actual problem.

What details should be included to make a bug report clear and actionable?  
Based on what I’ve learned, I should include:  
- steps to reproduce  
- expected result  
- actual result  
- screenshots or videos  
- device/browser details  
- severity or impact  
This makes it simple for developers to see what went wrong.

How can a tester make a bug easier to reproduce for developers?  
I try to write the steps clearly and in the exact order I followed.  
If the bug is inconsistent, I mention how often it happens.  
I also include logs or screen recordings when possible.

What is "bug severity" vs. "bug priority", and how do they impact whether a bug gets fixed?  
Severity is how serious the bug is.  
Priority is how soon it needs to be fixed.  
A bug can be high severity but low priority, or low severity but high priority depending on the situation.

Reflection

How would you report a UI glitch vs. a critical login failure differently?  
For a UI glitch, I would keep it simple with screenshots and a short explanation because it’s mostly visual.  
For a login failure, I would add detailed steps, logs, error messages, and mark it as high severity and high priority because it blocks all users.

If a developer dismisses a bug as "not important," how would you advocate for fixing it?  
I would explain the impact on the user and give examples of how it might cause confusion or harm the user experience.  
Sometimes developers don't see the user’s perspective, so I try to highlight the real impact.

How can screenshots, logs, and screen recordings improve your bug reports?  
They help developers understand the issue faster without guessing.  
A screenshot or recording shows exactly what I saw.  
Logs can help identify the source of the problem.  
These save time for both sides.
