# Agile Principles & Frameworks – Working in an Agile Team at Focus Bear

## What is Agile and How It Differs from Traditional Project Management

Agile is an approach to software development that focuses on flexibility, continuous feedback, and incremental delivery. Instead of planning everything upfront, Agile teams work in small cycles and adapt based on feedback and changing requirements.

Traditional project management usually follows a fixed plan where scope, timeline, and requirements are decided at the beginning. Changes later in the project can be difficult and slow to implement.

From my understanding so far, Agile works better for products like Focus Bear where user needs and features evolve continuously.

## Core Agile Values and Principles

The Agile Manifesto emphasizes:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a fixed plan  

Key principles include continuous improvement, frequent delivery, close collaboration, and adapting quickly to feedback. These principles help teams stay focused on delivering value instead of just completing tasks.

## Scrum vs Kanban – Key Differences

Scrum and Kanban are both Agile frameworks, but they work differently.

Scrum uses fixed-length sprints (for example, one or two weeks) where work is planned at the start of the sprint and reviewed at the end. It has defined roles and regular ceremonies like sprint planning and retrospectives.

Kanban focuses on continuous delivery instead of fixed sprints. Work items flow through a visual board, and limits are placed on how much work can be in progress at one time. Priorities can be adjusted at any point.

In simple terms, Scrum is more structured, while Kanban is more flexible.

## Why Focus Bear Uses Kanban

Focus Bear leans towards Kanban because it allows continuous prioritization and flexibility. Since the product evolves regularly and includes ongoing improvements, bug fixes, and enhancements, Kanban makes it easier to adjust priorities without waiting for a sprint cycle to end.

This approach supports faster feedback and smoother collaboration across the team.

## How Agile Principles Help in My Role

As a QA intern, Agile principles help me stay aligned with development changes and test features early. Continuous feedback allows me to report issues quickly and verify fixes without waiting for long release cycles.

Agile also encourages collaboration, which helps me understand feature intent and test more effectively.

## Agile Principle I Find Most Useful

The Agile principle I find most useful is **continuous feedback and improvement**. It allows me to learn quickly, improve my testing approach, and contribute to product quality throughout development instead of only at the end.

## Summary: Scrum vs Kanban

- Scrum uses fixed sprints and structured ceremonies  
- Kanban supports continuous flow and flexible prioritization  
- Scrum is useful for planned feature development  
- Kanban works better for ongoing work and evolving products like Focus Bear
