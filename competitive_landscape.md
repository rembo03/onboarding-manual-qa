1. My Research
I have not personally used other apps like Freedom, Cold Turkey, Tiimo, or Routinery.

I read reviews and researched how these apps work to understand the competitive landscape.

2. What Makes Focus Bear Different
Designed for people with ADHD and autism, helping with focus and routines.

Blocks distractions and also helps to build habits and daily routines.

Offers flexible focus modes like customizable breaks, Super-Pomodoro sessions, and allow lists.

Works across different devices and keeps blocks synchronized.

Launcher feature: opens only the apps or websites you need, avoiding all distractions.

3. Strengths of Other Apps
Freedom: simple and strong distraction blocking.

Cold Turkey: very strict blocking, hard to bypass.

Tiimo / Routinery: good for reminders and scheduling, not strict blocking.

4. Areas Where Focus Bear Could Improve
Add a strict lock-down mode for deep work.

Provide more detailed usage reports and analytics.

Offer a simpler setup for users who only want distraction blocking.

5. Personal Note
I have just started using Focus Bear.

I don’t know all its features yet, but I will research more and explore it daily to understand it better.
