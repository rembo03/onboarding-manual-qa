Understanding Agile Ceremonies & QA’s Role

Overview  
This task is about learning the main Scrum ceremonies and understanding how QA contributes to each one. Since Scrum depends on communication and collaboration, it’s important for me as QA to take an active part in every ceremony.

Research & Learn

What are the four main Scrum ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, Retrospective)?  
The four ceremonies are:  
1. Sprint Planning  
2. Daily Standup  
3. Sprint Review  
4. Sprint Retrospective  

What happens in each ceremony, and who participates?  
Sprint Planning: The whole team meets to decide what work will be done in the upcoming sprint.  
Daily Standup: A quick daily meeting where each person shares progress and blockers.  
Sprint Review: The team presents completed work to stakeholders.  
Sprint Retrospective: The team discusses what went well, what didn’t, and what can be improved.

What is QA’s role in each meeting?  
Sprint Planning: I clarify requirements, estimate testing effort, and plan my tasks.  
Daily Standup: I share what I tested, what I will test next, and any issues.  
Sprint Review: I confirm that features meet acceptance criteria and demo testing outcomes.  
Retrospective: I share testing challenges and suggest improvements for the next sprint.

How can testers use Sprint Planning to prepare for upcoming work?  
I read user stories early, check acceptance criteria, and ask questions if anything feels unclear.  
This helps me prepare my testing approach and identify risks before development begins.

Why is the Sprint Retrospective important for improving QA processes?  
It gives me a chance to reflect on what went well in testing and what didn’t.  
I can suggest better workflows, highlight bottlenecks, and improve communication with developers.

Reflection

What should QA do before, during, and after a Sprint Planning meeting?  
Before: Review user stories, list questions, check test data needs.  
During: Discuss testing scope, raise concerns, and estimate effort.  
After: Organize my tasks, prepare test cases or notes, and set up environments if needed.

If a Daily Standup is running long, what’s the best way to keep QA updates concise?  
I keep it simple:  
- What I did yesterday  
- What I will do today  
- Any blockers  
No long explanations — just enough for the team to understand.

How can QA drive continuous improvement during Sprint Retrospectives?  
I share problems I faced, suggest new testing practices, and highlight successes.  
I also listen to feedback from developers and propose ways to improve collaboration and quality in the next sprint.
