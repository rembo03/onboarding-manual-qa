Data Privacy & Confidentiality

Overview  
This task is about understanding how to handle sensitive data safely and follow Focus Bear’s privacy and confidentiality rules. Since the app deals with personal user information, it’s important that I handle everything carefully.

Research & Learn

Review Focus Bear’s privacy policy and note key takeaways.  
The privacy policy explains what data is collected, how it’s stored, and how it’s protected.  
The key points I learned are:  
- Only necessary data is collected.  
- Data is used only for improving the user’s experience.  
- User information must not be shared outside the team.  
- Security measures are in place to protect user data.

What types of data are considered confidential at Focus Bear?  
Confidential data includes:  
- user activity logs  
- email addresses and account information  
- internal documents  
- product roadmaps  
- bug reports that contain user details  
Anything not publicly shared by the company is treated as confidential.

What are best practices for handling confidential data?  
Some good practices include:  
- accessing data only when necessary  
- not downloading or storing sensitive files on personal devices  
- using secure passwords  
- keeping documents private and not sharing screenshots carelessly  
- not discussing confidential information outside the team

How should you respond to a suspected data breach or accidental disclosure of confidential information?  
I should report it immediately to my team lead or the responsible person.  
I should provide details on what happened and avoid trying to fix it alone.  
Quick reporting helps prevent further damage.

Reflection

What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?  
I make sure I log out from shared devices, avoid storing files locally, use strong passwords, and double-check before sharing anything.  
I also avoid keeping sensitive information in unprotected notes.

How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?  
I store files only on approved platforms (like Google Drive or company tools).  
I share information only with team members who need it.  
When disposing of files, I delete them properly instead of leaving them in random folders.

What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?  
Common mistakes include:  
- sending info to the wrong person  
- storing sensitive files on personal devices  
- not securing screens in public places  
- using weak passwords  
These can be avoided with careful double-checking and following company policies.

Task

Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.  
I plan to always double-check before sharing any screenshots or logs to make sure they don’t contain sensitive data.

Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.  
I will start using strong passwords and avoid saving sensitive information outside approved tools.
