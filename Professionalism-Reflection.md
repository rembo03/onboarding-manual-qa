Professionalism at Focus Bear

Overview  
This task is about understanding how to work professionally at Focus Bear while still contributing to a friendly, fun, and inclusive environment. Professionalism here is more about behaviour, communication, and respect rather than formality.

Research & Learn

What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment?  
Professional behaviour includes being respectful, replying on time, owning mistakes, listening to others, and being considerate in meetings.  
Unprofessional behaviour includes ignoring messages, blaming teammates, interrupting people, being rude, or reacting emotionally to feedback.

What does respectful communication look like in remote teams?  
It means having a friendly and clear tone, asking questions politely, keeping messages short but detailed, and avoiding assumptions.  
If there is a disagreement, I focus on the issue—not the person.  
I also respond to feedback calmly and try to understand the context.

How can you give and receive feedback professionally?  
While giving feedback, I focus on actions, not personality.  
I assume the other person meant well and explain my points clearly.  
When receiving feedback, I try not to get defensive. Instead, I ask questions to understand and improve.

Reflection

Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?  
Yes. In my previous company, we had daily stand-ups and clear communication channels.  
Everyone shared honest updates, discussed blockers openly, and respected each other’s time.  
This created a smooth workflow and reduced misunderstandings.  
Good teamwork was effective because everyone stayed accountable, helped each other, and maintained a respectful environment.

What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?  
From my past experience, I’ve seen how important clear communication is — even a small misunderstanding can slow down a team.  
So I make sure my messages are simple, polite, and easy to understand.  
I also respond on time, avoid assumptions, and ask for clarification whenever something seems unclear.

How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?  
I can bring the same habits I learned before: being supportive, appreciating others’ work, keeping discussions constructive, and staying calm even during pressure.  
Small actions like saying “thank you,” offering help, and keeping a friendly tone help build a positive environment.

How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?  
In my previous company, I prepared for stand-ups by reviewing my progress and jotting down what I planned next.  
Now, I do the same: I check my tasks, note any blockers, and show up prepared.  
This keeps meetings short, focused, and productive.

What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?  
Being proactive means taking initiative, clarifying doubts early, updating the team regularly, and not waiting until the last moment to ask for help.  
These habits helped me before, and I continue applying them here.

How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?  
From my past experience, I follow up politely with a short summary of what I need.  
If there is still no response and the task is blocking progress, I escalate by tagging the person or informing a supervisor — but only when necessary.  
Escalation should be done carefully and professionally.

What are some things you won't do?  
I won’t ignore important messages, behave rudely, blame teammates, or share confidential information.  
I also avoid reacting emotionally in discussions or causing unnecessary conflict.
