Get familiar with GitHub Projects

Overview  
This task is about learning how GitHub Projects works and how it helps keep QA work organised. It is mainly used to track issues, see progress, and manage what needs to be done during testing.

Research & Learn

1. What GitHub Projects are and how they work  
GitHub Projects is like a board where tasks are shown in different columns.  
You add issues to the board and move them depending on their progress.  
This makes it easy to see what work is pending and what is finished.

2. How issues are created, assigned, and moved through columns  
- When you find a bug or need to document something, you create an issue.  
- You can assign the issue to someone so it’s clear who is responsible.  
- Move the issue to “In Progress” when you start working on it.  
- Move it to “Done” once testing or fixing is completed.  

3. What labels, milestones, and assignees are  
- Labels help group issues by type (bug, task, improvement, etc.).  
- Milestones are used when issues belong to the same goal or release.  
- Assignees show who will handle the issue.  

4. How GitHub Projects helps track testing progress  
You can use the board to see which tasks you still need to test.  
As you work, you move issues across the board.  
This gives a clear picture of your progress and helps avoid missing anything.

Reflection

1. How to create a new issue for a bug found during testing  
Go to the Issues tab and click “New Issue”.  
Write a simple title and describe the problem clearly.  
Add the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected, and what actually happened.  
Attach screenshots or videos if needed.  
Add a label like “bug” and assign it if required.

2. How to prioritise issues in GitHub Projects  
You can use labels such as “high priority” or “low priority”.  
Another way is to arrange issues higher or lower within the “To Do” column.  
This helps decide what needs attention first.

3. Advantages of using GitHub Projects for QA  
- Everything is organised in one place.  
- Easy to see which tasks are done and which are pending.  
- Helps you follow a proper workflow.  
- Makes communication with developers easier.  
- Better visibility of overall testing progress.
