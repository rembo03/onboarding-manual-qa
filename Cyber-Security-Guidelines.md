Cyber Security Guidelines – Reflection

Overview  
This task is about understanding how to protect company data, user information, and my own accounts by following strong cyber security habits. Since I work remotely, I need to be extra careful with passwords, devices, and suspicious links.

Research & Learn

What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?  
Some common threats include phishing emails, malware downloads, weak passwords, unsecured Wi-Fi networks, and social engineering attempts.  
Remote work increases the risk because people use multiple devices and internet connections.

What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?  
- Use strong, unique passwords  
- Enable 2FA on all important accounts  
- Keep devices updated  
- Avoid installing unknown software  
- Use secure Wi-Fi  
- Lock your device when not in use  

Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?  
If I step away without locking my computer, anyone nearby could access work files, emails, or confidential information.  
Locking the screen prevents accidental or intentional misuse.

How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?  
I avoid clicking any link that looks suspicious.  
I check the sender’s email, verify spelling mistakes, and hover over links before clicking.  
If I’m unsure, I ask someone on the team or simply delete the message.

What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?  
A strong password includes lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols, and is long.  
Password managers help create and store secure passwords so I don’t reuse weak ones.

Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?  
2FA adds an extra layer of protection even if someone steals my password.  
I should enable it on all important accounts, especially work accounts, email, cloud storage, and communication tools.

Reflection

What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?  
I already use strong passwords and avoid clicking unknown links.  
I can improve by using a password manager more consistently and enabling 2FA on every work-related account.

How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?  
I can set reminders, update passwords regularly, and keep 2FA enabled everywhere.  
Making security part of my daily routine helps me avoid risky shortcuts.

What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?  
- Use long, unique passwords  
- Store them in a password manager  
- Turn on 2FA for all accounts  
- Avoid using the same password in multiple places  

What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?  
I would immediately change my password, enable 2FA, and inform my manager or the responsible team at Focus Bear.  
Quick reporting helps prevent further damage.

Task

Ensure your work accounts have strong passwords and enable 2FA where possible.  
(I updated my passwords and enabled 2FA on my main accounts.)

Review your password storage method—if you’re not using a password manager, consider setting one up.  
(I started using a password manager to avoid weak or repeated passwords.)

Set up your computer and phone to automatically lock after a few minutes.  
(I enabled auto-lock on both devices.)

Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.  
I will regularly review my account activity and update my passwords to reduce risk.
