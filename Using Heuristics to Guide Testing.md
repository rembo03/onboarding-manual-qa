Using Heuristics to Guide Testing

Overview  
This task is about understanding how heuristics (simple rules of thumb) can help me decide what to test when requirements are not fully clear. In real testing situations, I don’t always get complete instructions, so heuristics guide my decisions.

Research & Learn

Watch James Bach and Michael Bolton’s talks on heuristics in software testing.  
Yes, I watched short.

Read blog posts by James Bach about how experienced testers use heuristics to find bugs.  
I read some articles.

What are heuristics in software testing, and why are they useful?  
Heuristics are simple guidelines or mental shortcuts that help me decide what to test.  
They are useful because they give me direction when I don’t have complete requirements or when the feature is too big to test fully.

What are some common testing heuristics (e.g., "The Rule of Three," "Consistency Heuristic")?  
Some examples I learned:  
- The Rule of Three: If I see one problem, I look for two more similar ones.  
- Consistency Heuristic: I check if the feature behaves consistently with the rest of the app.  
- CRUD Heuristic: Create, Read, Update, Delete — helps test basic actions.  
- RCRCRC: Recent, Core, Risky, Configuration, Repaired, Chronic — helps pick what to test first.

How do experienced testers use heuristics to prioritize what to test first?  
They look at what is most important, most risky, or most likely to break.  
Heuristics help them decide where to start without wasting time on low-impact areas.

When should testers be cautious about over-relying on heuristics?  
Heuristics are helpful, but they are not perfect.  
If I rely only on rules of thumb, I might miss something important.  
Sometimes I still need structured tests or clear documentation to avoid wrong assumptions.

Reflection

If you had only 15 minutes to test a new Focus Bear feature, how would heuristics help you decide what to test first?  
I would use heuristics like RCRCRC to focus on the most important and risky parts first.  
Instead of testing everything, I would check core flows, common actions, and anything that seems likely to fail.

How can heuristics help you find edge cases and unexpected bugs?  
Heuristics push me to try things that are not obvious, like inconsistent behaviour, limits, unusual inputs, or variations in order.  
This helps me discover bugs that normal test cases might not cover.

What risks come with using gut instinct vs. structured test cases?  
If I rely only on instinct, I might miss important checks or forget to test key areas.  
If I rely only on structured tests, I might miss unexpected issues.  
A mix of both is safer — structured tests for consistency, heuristics for deeper exploration.
