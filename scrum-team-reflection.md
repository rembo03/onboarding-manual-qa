How to Be a Member of a Scrum Team

Overview  
This task is about understanding how QA works inside an Agile Scrum team. Since Scrum is based on collaboration and fast feedback, it’s important for me as QA to know what happens during each sprint and how I can support the team.

Research & Learn

What are the key roles in a Scrum team, and where does QA fit in?  
The main roles are the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.  
QA is part of the Development Team, working alongside developers to ensure the product meets quality standards.  
My role is to test early, give feedback, and help prevent issues before release.

What happens in a Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, and Retrospective?  
Sprint Planning: The team decides what work will be done during the sprint.  
Daily Standup: Everyone shares what they did, what they will do, and if they have blockers.  
Sprint Review: The team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders.  
Retrospective: The team discusses what went well and what can be improved.

How does QA help the team maintain quality throughout the sprint?  
I test features as soon as they are ready, report issues quickly, and help make sure each story meets acceptance criteria.  
I also do exploratory testing and give early feedback to avoid major problems later.

What is shift-left testing, and why is early involvement of QA important?  
Shift-left testing means testing earlier in the development process.  
When QA is involved early, we catch problems sooner, understand requirements better, and help the team save time by preventing rework.

How do testers collaborate with developers, product managers, and designers in Scrum?  
I work with developers to verify behaviour, with product managers to clarify requirements, and with designers to ensure the UI/UX matches expectations.  
Communication is constant throughout the sprint.

Reflection

How should QA prepare for a Sprint Planning meeting?  
I review the upcoming stories, check acceptance criteria, and ask questions if anything is unclear.  
This helps me estimate testing effort and plan my work for the sprint.

What information should testers share in a Daily Standup?  
I share what I tested yesterday, what I plan to test today, and if anything is blocking me.  
If I found a critical bug, I mention it so the team is aware.

If a feature is about to be released, but QA finds a critical bug, what should happen next?  
The release should be paused.  
I would report the bug immediately, explain the impact, and work with the team to decide whether it needs an urgent fix or if the release should be delayed.  
Quality should not be compromised.
