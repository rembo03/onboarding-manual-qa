Learn about screen recording tools

Overview  
This task is about understanding different tools that can be used for screen recording and screenshots. These recordings help developers see exactly what happened during a bug, which makes fixing issues much easier.

Research & Learn

1. Best free and paid screen recording tools for Windows and macOS
Windows (Free):
- Xbox Game Bar
- OBS Studio
- ShareX

Windows (Paid):
- Camtasia
- Snagit

macOS (Free):
- Built-in screen recorder (Shift + Command + 5)
- OBS Studio

macOS (Paid):
- ScreenFlow
- CleanShot X

2. How to record a specific part of the screen
Windows:
- ShareX or OBS allows selecting only one window or a custom region.
- Xbox Game Bar records active windows only.

macOS:
- Press Shift + Command + 5.
- Choose the “Record Selected Portion” option to drag and record only a part of the screen.

3. Best practices for screen recordings in bug reports
- Keep the recording short and focused on the issue.
- Start recording a few seconds before reproducing the bug.
- Show steps clearly so developers can repeat them.
- Highlight clicks if possible (some tools show pointer clicks).
- Avoid background noise if recording audio is not needed.

4. How to reduce video file size while keeping good quality
- Export in 720p instead of 1080p if high resolution is not required.
- Use MP4 format because it compresses well.
- Tools like HandBrake can compress videos further.
- Reduce the frame rate if the recording doesn’t need fast motion.

Reflection

1. Key information to include when submitting a screen recording
- The steps you followed
- The expected result vs. the actual issue
- The device or browser you used
- The version of the app or website
- Any visible error messages

2. How to avoid sharing sensitive information
- Close personal apps, chats, or email tabs before recording.
- Blur or crop areas that contain private data.
- Record only a small part of the screen if possible.

3. How to record and describe bugs that happen during fast interactions
- Use a tool with a high frame rate so fast movements are captured clearly.
- Record multiple attempts if the bug is hard to catch.
- In the description, mention how fast the action needs to be (for example: “double tap quickly”).
- Add notes explaining exactly when the bug appears in the video.
