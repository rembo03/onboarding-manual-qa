Understanding how to do manual QA

Overview  
This task is about learning the basics of manual QA testing and understanding ideas like context-driven testing. The goal is to know how to test software in a practical way without relying on automation.

Research & Learn

1. What manual QA testing is and how it differs from automated testing  
Manual testing is when a tester checks the app by using it directly, without scripts or automation tools.  
Automated testing uses code or tools to run tests repeatedly.  
Manual QA is better for finding unexpected issues, UI problems, or behaviour that feels “off”, while automation is good for repeating the same tests many times.

2. What context-driven testing is and how it challenges traditional testing  
Context-driven testing says that testing should change depending on the project, team, timeline, and risks.  
There is no “one fixed way” to test.  
Instead of following strict processes, you adjust your strategy based on what the situation needs.

3. The seven principles of context-driven testing  
- The value of any practice depends on its context.  
- There are no best practices — only good practices in context.  
- People, working together, are the most important part of any project’s context.  
- Projects unfold over time in ways that are often unpredictable.  
- The product is a solution to a problem, and problems can change.  
- Good testing is a challenging intellectual process.  
- Only through judgment and skill can testers do their best work.

4. Exploratory testing vs scripted testing  
Exploratory testing:  
- You learn the product while testing it.  
- You explore freely, follow your observations, and find issues through trial and curiosity.  
- Useful when requirements are unclear or new features are being tested.

Scripted testing:  
- You follow a written set of steps.  
- Good for repeating tests or checking stable features.

A good tester uses both, depending on the situation.

5. Skills that make a great manual tester  
- Curiosity and asking “why?”  
- Observing small details  
- Thinking from the user’s point of view  
- Communication skills for writing clear bug reports  
- Ability to explore without getting lost  
- Patience and consistency  
- Logical thinking and problem-solving  

Reflection

1. Why context matters, and how testing Focus Bear might differ from testing another app  
Every app has different users, goals, risks, and expectations.  
For Focus Bear, routines, focus sessions, and motivational tools matter.  
Testing a banking app or a gaming app would require completely different priorities.

2. How manual testing can be both structured and adaptable  
You can follow a plan or checklist, but at the same time stay open to exploring new areas when something looks strange or unexpected.  
You adjust based on what you discover.

3. How to test a new feature without a predefined script  
Start by understanding what the feature is supposed to do.  
Try using it normally, then try edge cases or unusual actions.  
Take notes of anything that looks wrong or confusing.  
Check how it interacts with other parts of the app.

4. How to decide what to test when requirements are not clear  
Try to think from a user’s perspective:  
- What would a user try to do?  
- What problems could they face?  
- What happens if the user does something unexpected?  
You explore the feature until you understand its behaviour and possible risks.
