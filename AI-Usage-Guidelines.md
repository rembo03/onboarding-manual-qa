Use of AI Tools – Reflection & Guidelines

Overview  
This task is about understanding how to use AI tools responsibly while protecting data privacy and using my own judgement. AI can be helpful, but it should be used carefully and never replace critical thinking.

Research & Learn

What AI tools are typically used for your role?  
As a QA intern, I can use AI tools for:  
- rewriting or improving documentation  
- summarising long text  
- generating test case ideas  
- understanding error logs  
- learning concepts faster  
- drafting clear bug reports or communication  

What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?  
Benefits:  
- saves time  
- helps with clarity in writing  
- gives quick explanations  
- helps brainstorm test scenarios  

Risks:  
- AI may give incorrect or outdated information  
- confidential data could be leaked if pasted into a public AI tool  
- over-reliance can reduce personal learning  
- AI output may sound unnatural if not reviewed properly  

What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?  
I should never enter:  
- user data  
- internal documents  
- API keys or credentials  
- internal company conversations  
- any confidential or sensitive project details  
Only generic or anonymised content should be used.

How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?  
I double-check the content by:  
- reviewing for errors or missing context  
- comparing it with official documentation  
- making sure it matches Focus Bear’s tone and policies  
- editing it to sound natural and personalised  

Reflection

When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?  
I should use AI for drafting, brainstorming, or rephrasing.  
But for actual decisions, testing, or reporting bugs, I rely on my own judgement and knowledge.  
AI supports my work—it shouldn’t replace my thinking.

How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?  
I can use AI as a helper, not the main problem solver.  
I review everything carefully, make changes, and use AI only when I truly need support.  
I also try to learn from AI outputs instead of copying them blindly.

What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?  
- Never paste sensitive or internal information  
- Only use general examples  
- Double-check before entering anything into a prompt  
- Use AI offline or company-approved tools when necessary  

Task

Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.  
I used AI to rewrite one of my Markdown reflections to make it clearer and more organized.

Review the AI-generated output critically—did it require editing or fact-checking?  
Yes, I edited the tone to match my own style and removed anything that sounded too generic or incorrect.

Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.  
I will always review, edit, and fact-check AI outputs before using them, and I will never paste confidential information into the tool.
