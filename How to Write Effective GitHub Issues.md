How to Write Effective GitHub Issues

Overview  
This task is about learning how to write clear and useful GitHub issues. A well-written issue helps developers understand the problem quickly and fix it without confusion.

Research & Learn

What are the key components of a good GitHub issue?  
From what I’ve learned, a good issue includes:  
- a clear title  
- a short description  
- steps to reproduce  
- expected vs actual result  
- screenshots or videos  
- device/browser details  
These details make the issue easy to understand.

What is the difference between a bug report, feature request, and technical task?  
A bug report describes something that is broken or not working as expected.  
A feature request suggests a new function or improvement.  
A technical task is usually something for developers, like refactoring or backend work, not related to visible bugs.

How do labels, milestones, and assignees help organize issues in GitHub Projects?  
Labels help categorize issues (bug, enhancement, UI, etc.).  
Milestones help group issues under a specific release or goal.  
Assignees show who is responsible for fixing or testing the issue.  
These keep the project organized and easier to track.

What are some examples of well-written vs poorly written GitHub issues?  
A well-written issue explains the problem clearly, includes reproducible steps, and has screenshots.  
A poorly written issue is vague, unclear, missing steps, or too short, which makes it hard for developers to understand the problem.

Reflection

How would you write a bug report for a crash in Focus Bear?  
I would include:  
- the exact steps before the crash  
- what I expected to happen  
- what actually happened  
- a screen recording if possible  
- device info and app version  
I would also mark it as high severity since a crash blocks usage.

How can adding steps to reproduce help developers fix issues faster?  
Clear steps allow developers to follow exactly what I did.  
If they can reproduce the issue easily, they can fix it faster.  
Without steps, they might waste time guessing what happened.

If a developer asks for more details on an issue I created, what might I have missed?  
Most likely, I missed the exact steps, the environment details, or evidence like screenshots.  
Sometimes I may not have explained the expected behaviour properly.  
This reminds me to be more specific in future issues.
