How Manual QA Fits into the Overall Testing Approach vs. Automated QA

Overview  
This task is about understanding where manual QA fits in the bigger testing process and how it works alongside automated testing. Both have different strengths, and knowing when to use each one helps create a complete testing strategy.

Research & Learn

What are the key differences between manual and automated testing?  
From my understanding, the biggest difference is that manual testing is done by me directly using the app, while automated testing uses scripts or tools to run tests automatically.  
Manual testing is better for usability, exploratory testing, and spotting visual or behaviour issues.  
Automation is better for repetitive tasks and large test suites that need to be run often.

What types of testing are best suited for manual QA vs. automation?  
Manual testing is best for:  
- exploratory testing  
- UI/UX checks  
- testing new features  
- edge cases  
- situations requiring human judgement  
Automation is best for:  
- regression testing  
- repeated test cases  
- performance tests  
- long workflows that are time-consuming to repeat manually  

Why do some teams focus too much on automation and neglect manual testing?  
Sometimes teams believe automation will catch everything, or they want faster releases, so they invest heavily in automated tests.  
But this can lead to missing usability issues or unexpected behaviours that only show up when someone manually interacts with the app.  
Automation can’t replace human observation.

How do manual testers collaborate with automation engineers in an Agile team?  
From what I’ve seen, manual testers and automation engineers work together by sharing test cases, identifying which tests should be automated, and reviewing failures.  
Manual testers help suggest areas where automation would be useful.  
Automation engineers keep scripts updated, while manual testers focus on areas that require exploration or human judgement.

Reflection

If Focus Bear had 100% test automation, why would manual QA still be needed?  
Even with full automation, I would still be needed to catch things that automated scripts can’t, like confusing UX, changes in user flow, layout issues, or unexpected behaviours.  
Automation won’t think like a user, but I can.

What are some limitations of automated testing that manual testing can cover?  
Automation can’t fully understand design, wording, colours, or how smooth an experience feels.  
It also struggles with new features where the expected behaviour isn’t fully clear.  
Manual testing can cover these gaps and find issues automation might skip.

How can manual testers help improve automated test coverage over time?  
I can help by identifying which areas are stable enough to automate, writing clear bug reports, and sharing patterns I notice in repeated issues.  
As I test manually, I understand which parts of the app are used often — this helps automation engineers decide what should be automated first.  
My feedback helps shape the automation roadmap.
