Tracking and Prioritising Defects

Overview  
This task is about understanding how to sort, track, and prioritize defects based on how serious they are and how they impact users. Not every bug needs the same level of attention, so knowing how to classify them helps the team work efficiently.

Research & Learn

What is the difference between bug severity and bug priority?  
Severity describes how serious the bug is and how much it affects the app.  
Priority describes how soon the bug should be fixed.  
A bug can be high severity but low priority, or the other way around.

How do teams decide which bugs to fix first? (Business impact, risk, effort, etc.)  
Teams look at how the bug affects users, how risky it is, how often it occurs, and how much it blocks progress.  
They also consider business needs, deadlines, and how quickly the fix can be done.

What tools can QA use to track defects in an Agile workflow?  
Some common tools include GitHub Issues, Jira, Trello, and Linear.  
These tools help me track bug status, add details, and see progress throughout the sprint.

What happens when QA, developers, and product teams disagree on priority?  
Usually, the team discusses the impact, risk, and effort.  
If we still disagree, the product manager usually makes the final call.  
As QA, I can explain my perspective clearly, but I also follow the team decision.

Reflection

How would you prioritise a cosmetic UI issue vs. a login failure?  
A cosmetic UI issue is low severity and low priority.  
A login failure is high severity and high priority because it blocks users from using the app.  
I would prioritise the login issue first without hesitation.

If a developer says a bug is too minor to fix, how would you respond?  
I would explain why the bug might still matter to the user and give examples if possible.  
If it’s truly minor, I would mark it as low priority and keep it documented.  
My goal is not to argue but to make sure the impact is understood.

How can testers ensure that low-priority bugs don’t get forgotten?  
I keep them documented with clear labels and link them to a milestone or project board.  
Even if they’re not urgent, they stay visible so they can be picked up later.  
Reviewing old issues regularly also helps.
