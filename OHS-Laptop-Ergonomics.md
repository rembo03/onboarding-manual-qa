Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

Overview  
This task is about understanding how to set up a comfortable and safe workstation, especially when using a laptop. Since most of my work is desk-based, having good ergonomics helps prevent strain, pain, and fatigue.

Research & Learn

What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?  
Using only a laptop often forces me to bend my neck down and hunch my shoulders.  
This can cause neck strain, back pain, wrist discomfort, and eye fatigue.  
Long-term, it can lead to posture issues.

What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop?  
Equipment that helps includes:  
- a laptop stand to raise the screen  
- an external keyboard and mouse  
- an ergonomic chair  
- a cushion or footrest  
- a larger monitor for better visibility  

What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?  
The top of the monitor should be at eye level.  
My chair height should allow my feet to sit flat on the floor.  
I keep my shoulders relaxed and wrists straight.  
The screen should also be at arm’s length to reduce eye strain.

What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use?  
Some helpful habits include:  
- taking movement breaks every 30–45 minutes  
- doing posture checks  
- following the 20–20–20 eye rule  
- stretching hands, neck, and shoulders  
- avoiding sitting for too long without shifting positions  

Reflection

What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?  
I don’t have an adjustable chair, so I use my study table to set up the laptop at a comfortable height.  
I added a small stand (and sometimes a book under the laptop) to raise the screen, which makes it easier on my neck.

What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?  
I try to sit upright, keep my back supported by the chair, and avoid bending forward.  
I also take more frequent breaks so my neck and shoulders don’t get stiff.

How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?  
I use Focus Bear movement reminders and also set short posture alerts.  
These help me stay aware even when I’m working for long periods.

Task

Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices.  
(I raised the laptop on my study table using a stand/book and positioned it so I don’t have to bend my neck too much.)

Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.  
(A laptop stand helps the most, and I plan to get an external keyboard when possible.)

Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements.  
(Using reminders helped reduce shoulder tension and made me move more often.)

Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.  
(I adjusted the laptop height on my table and started taking breaks every 45 minutes.)
