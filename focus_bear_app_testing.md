Focus Bear App – First Time User Testing Report
1. Overview
This document contains my first-time user experience while installing and using the Focus Bear app.
I tested the app as a brand-new user to identify confusing areas and onboarding improvements.

2. Issues Found 
Issue 1 – Onboarding feels unclear
The app starts without explaining what a “Focus Session” is.
A new user may not understand the purpose or how to start correctly.

Impact: Confusing first experience for new users.
Suggestion: Add a short intro tutorial.

Issue 2 – Routine setup lacks explanation
When creating a routine, the app directly shows settings without describing why routines matter.

Impact: User may skip the feature due to lack of clarity.
Suggestion: Add one info screen: “Why routines help”.

Issue 3 – Some instructions feel long or technical
Certain text descriptions are lengthy and may overwhelm new users.

Impact: Users may skip reading and miss important info.
Suggestion: Shorten instructions using simple language.

3. Improvement Ideas (Required: 2)
Idea 1 — Add a 3-step onboarding tutorial
The app could show a small walkthrough:

What is a Focus Session

How to use Routines

How the app improves productivity

This will immediately increase user clarity.

5. Conclusion
The Focus Bear app works well, but the onboarding and clarity for first-time users can be improved.
The above issues and suggestions aim to enhance new-user experience.
